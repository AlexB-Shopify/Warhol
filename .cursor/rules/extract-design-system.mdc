# Extract Design System Workflow

Follow these steps to derive a design system (fonts, colors, sizes) from PPTX template files.

## Prerequisites

- One or more `.pptx` files to analyze
- Python environment is set up

## Step 1: Run Extraction

For a single file:
```
python scripts/extract_design_system.py <file.pptx> -o design_systems/<name>.yaml --name "<Name>"
```

For a directory of templates:
```
python scripts/extract_design_system.py <template_dir> -o design_systems/<name>.yaml --name "<Name>"
```

## Step 2: Review Results

Read the generated YAML file and report to the user:
- Font choices (title and body fonts with sizes)
- Color palette (primary, secondary, accent, text colors)
- Any notable findings

## Step 3: Suggest Adjustments

If the extracted values seem off (e.g., unusual fonts, missing accent colors), suggest manual adjustments to the YAML file.

The design system YAML format is:

```yaml
name: My Brand
fonts:
  title_font: Helvetica
  body_font: Helvetica
  title_size: 44
  subtitle_size: 28
  body_size: 18
  bullet_size: 16
colors:
  primary: "#1a73e8"
  secondary: "#34a853"
  accent: "#ea4335"
  text_dark: "#202124"
  text_light: "#5f6368"
  background: "#ffffff"
```
