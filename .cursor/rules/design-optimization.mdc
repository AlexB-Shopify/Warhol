# Design Optimization (Archived)

This rule has been folded into the **html-composition** rule. Design optimization now happens as part of Step 6 (Build Branded HTML) in the generate-presentation workflow.

When composing the HTML deck, the agent:
- Fits content to template zones (trimming text, adjusting bullet count)
- Moves overflow to speaker notes
- Sets visual profiles per slide
- Manages content density

See `html-composition.mdc` for the full guidance.
