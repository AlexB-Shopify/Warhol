# Presentation Author

This rule defines the writing standards for all presentation content you produce. Apply these principles whenever writing content for `content_inventory.json` or `deck_schema.json`.

## Title Writing

Titles are the most important text on every slide. The audience should understand the entire presentation story by reading only the titles in sequence.

### Do

- **Tell, don't label**: "Platform processes 10M+ orders daily" not "Platform Overview"
- **Lead with the insight**: "Customer retention increased 35%" not "Retention Metrics"
- **Use active voice**: "We reduced costs by $2M" not "Cost Reduction Achieved"
- **Be specific**: "3 reasons merchants choose Shopify" not "Why Shopify"
- **Front-load the key word**: "Revenue: $4.2B and growing" not "A look at our revenue numbers"

### Don't

- Generic labels: "Introduction", "Overview", "Summary", "Conclusion"
- Questions as titles (unless deliberately rhetorical for a hook slide)
- Titles longer than 10 words
- ALL CAPS (emphasis belongs in design, not typography hacks)

## Bullet Writing (The 6x6 Rule)

Each bullet slide: maximum 6 bullets, maximum 6 words per bullet.

### Technique

1. Start with the verb or key number
2. Cut articles (a, the, an) ruthlessly
3. Cut filler ("in order to" --> "to", "the ability to" --> "can")
4. Use parallel structure (all bullets start the same way grammatically)
5. Each bullet = one idea, no semicolons joining two thoughts

### Examples

Bad:
- "We have seen that our enterprise customers tend to have higher retention rates compared to SMB customers"

Good:
- "Enterprise retention 2x higher than SMB"

Bad:
- "The platform is able to handle more than 10 million orders per day"

Good:
- "10M+ orders processed daily"

## Speaker Notes

Speaker notes are the presentation's intellectual backbone. A slide with a great title and 3 bullets is only as good as the 60-90 second spoken narrative that brings it to life. Speaker notes complement the slide — they add the depth, evidence, and interpretation that slides can't carry.

### Length Requirements

| Slide Type | Target Length |
|---|---|
| content, bullet_list, two_column, comparison | 6-10 sentences |
| data_point, quote | 4-6 sentences |
| title, closing | 3-4 sentences |
| section_header | 2-3 sentences |

### Principles

- **Conversational tone** -- write as if talking to a colleague, not reading a report
- **Bridge slides** -- start each note with a transition from the previous slide ("Building on that growth...")
- **Add context the slide can't** -- the "why" behind the data, the anecdote behind the stat, the interpretation behind the figure
- **Interpret, don't restate** -- "Revenue grew 40%" is on the slide. The note should explain WHY, what drove it, what it means
- **Include evidence** -- cite specific numbers, sources, examples that support the slide's claim
- **Include the key talking point** -- what's the one thing the presenter must say on this slide?

### Example (shallow — avoid)

Slide title: "Revenue grew 40% in Q4"

Speaker notes: "This was our strongest quarter ever. Revenue was up 40%. Let's look at what's next."

### Example (deep — target this quality)

Slide title: "Revenue grew 40% in Q4"

Speaker notes: "Let's pause on this number because it tells a bigger story than just top-line growth. This was our strongest quarter ever, and what makes it remarkable is the composition of that growth. The enterprise segment drove 60% of the increase, which is a significant shift from Q2 when SMB dominated our revenue mix. But here's what I find most telling — this growth came while we actually reduced customer acquisition costs by 15%. That's not a coincidence. The key driver was expansion revenue from existing accounts, particularly our mid-market clients upgrading to enterprise tiers. When existing customers spend more, it tells us two things: our product-market fit is strengthening, and our pricing model rewards deeper engagement. For context, our net revenue retention hit 128%, which puts us in the top quartile of SaaS companies by that metric. What this means for your planning is that we should be investing more in account expansion than net-new acquisition — the data says that's where the efficient growth is."

## Content Density by Slide Type

| Slide Type | Text Budget | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Title + subtitle only | Maximum impact, minimal text |
| `section_header` | Title + optional subtitle | Breathing room, signals a shift |
| `content` | Title + 3-5 bullets or 2-3 short paragraphs | Core information delivery |
| `two_column` | Title + balanced content in each column | Comparison or parallel ideas |
| `bullet_list` | Title + 4-6 bullets | Scannable list of points |
| `quote` | One quote + attribution | Let the words breathe |
| `comparison` | Title + two sides with minimal text | Visual contrast |
| `chart` | Title + one key callout | Let the data speak |
| `closing` | Title + CTA or contact info | Clear next step |

## Audience Calibration

Adjust writing style based on the target audience:

- **Executive**: Lead with outcomes and business impact. Numbers first, details available on request. Short, decisive language.
- **Technical**: Precision matters. Use correct terminology. Include architecture-level context. Speaker notes can go deeper.
- **Sales/customer-facing**: Benefits over features. Social proof (quotes, logos, case studies). Aspirational language.
- **Internal/team**: Can be more candid. Include blockers and risks alongside wins. Action items welcome.

## Content Extraction Quality

When extracting content from source documents:

- **Preserve precision** -- keep exact numbers, don't round or paraphrase metrics
- **Capture the hierarchy** -- distinguish headline claims from supporting evidence
- **Flag quotable moments** -- anything that would land well spoken aloud goes in `quotes`
- **Assess ruthlessly** -- mark sections `low` importance if they're background context that won't make the final deck
- **Synthesize, don't summarize** -- a good section `content` field distills the insight, it doesn't just shorten the original
