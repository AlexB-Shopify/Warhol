# Presentation Author

This rule defines the writing standards for all presentation content you produce. Apply these principles whenever writing content for `content_inventory.json` or `deck_schema.json`.

## Title Writing

Titles are the most important text on every slide. The audience should understand the entire presentation story by reading only the titles in sequence.

### Do

- **Tell, don't label**: "Platform processes 10M+ orders daily" not "Platform Overview"
- **Lead with the insight**: "Customer retention increased 35%" not "Retention Metrics"
- **Use active voice**: "We reduced costs by $2M" not "Cost Reduction Achieved"
- **Be specific**: "3 reasons merchants choose Shopify" not "Why Shopify"
- **Front-load the key word**: "Revenue: $4.2B and growing" not "A look at our revenue numbers"

### Don't

- Generic labels: "Introduction", "Overview", "Summary", "Conclusion"
- Questions as titles (unless deliberately rhetorical for a hook slide)
- Titles longer than 10 words
- ALL CAPS (emphasis belongs in design, not typography hacks)

## Bullet Writing (The 6x6 Rule)

Each bullet slide: maximum 6 bullets, maximum 6 words per bullet.

### Technique

1. Start with the verb or key number
2. Cut articles (a, the, an) ruthlessly
3. Cut filler ("in order to" --> "to", "the ability to" --> "can")
4. Use parallel structure (all bullets start the same way grammatically)
5. Each bullet = one idea, no semicolons joining two thoughts

### Examples

Bad:
- "We have seen that our enterprise customers tend to have higher retention rates compared to SMB customers"

Good:
- "Enterprise retention 2x higher than SMB"

Bad:
- "The platform is able to handle more than 10 million orders per day"

Good:
- "10M+ orders processed daily"

## Speaker Notes

Speaker notes are what the presenter says out loud. They complement the slide -- they don't repeat it.

### Principles

- **Conversational tone** -- write as if talking to a colleague, not reading a report
- **Bridge slides** -- start each note with a transition from the previous slide ("Building on that growth...")
- **Add context the slide can't** -- the "why" behind the data, the anecdote behind the stat
- **Keep to 3-4 sentences** -- enough to guide the presenter, not a script to read verbatim
- **Include the key talking point** -- what's the one thing the presenter must say on this slide?

### Example

Slide title: "Revenue grew 40% in Q4"
Slide bullets: key metrics

Speaker notes: "This was our strongest quarter ever, driven primarily by the enterprise segment. Worth noting -- this growth came while we actually reduced customer acquisition costs by 15%. The key driver was expansion revenue from existing accounts, which tells us our product-market fit is strengthening."

## Content Density by Slide Type

| Slide Type | Text Budget | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Title + subtitle only | Maximum impact, minimal text |
| `section_header` | Title + optional subtitle | Breathing room, signals a shift |
| `content` | Title + 3-5 bullets or 2-3 short paragraphs | Core information delivery |
| `two_column` | Title + balanced content in each column | Comparison or parallel ideas |
| `bullet_list` | Title + 4-6 bullets | Scannable list of points |
| `quote` | One quote + attribution | Let the words breathe |
| `comparison` | Title + two sides with minimal text | Visual contrast |
| `chart` | Title + one key callout | Let the data speak |
| `closing` | Title + CTA or contact info | Clear next step |

## Audience Calibration

Adjust writing style based on the target audience:

- **Executive**: Lead with outcomes and business impact. Numbers first, details available on request. Short, decisive language.
- **Technical**: Precision matters. Use correct terminology. Include architecture-level context. Speaker notes can go deeper.
- **Sales/customer-facing**: Benefits over features. Social proof (quotes, logos, case studies). Aspirational language.
- **Internal/team**: Can be more candid. Include blockers and risks alongside wins. Action items welcome.

## Content Extraction Quality

When extracting content from source documents:

- **Preserve precision** -- keep exact numbers, don't round or paraphrase metrics
- **Capture the hierarchy** -- distinguish headline claims from supporting evidence
- **Flag quotable moments** -- anything that would land well spoken aloud goes in `quotes`
- **Assess ruthlessly** -- mark sections `low` importance if they're background context that won't make the final deck
- **Synthesize, don't summarize** -- a good section `content` field distills the insight, it doesn't just shorten the original
